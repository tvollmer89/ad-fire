          <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
          <p>
            A/D Fire Protection Systems (&quot;Company&quot;) values its relationship with visitors and customers and makes every effort to safeguard any personal information collected, while also making product and service information available to our customers.  This section describes the overall privacy practices of Company.  It does not apply to companies other than Company nor to anyone not employed by Company.
          </p>
          <p>
            This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect: on the Site, in e-mail, text and other electronic messages between you and the Site.  It does not apply to information collected by us offline or through any other means.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are two types of information collected on the Site: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information.
          </p> <strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong>
          <p>
            Personally Identifiable Information (&quot;personal information&quot;) is information that identifies you as an individual, whether directly such as by your name, mailing address, or email address, or indirectly such as by your internet protocol (IP) address, telephone number, age range, etc. Personal information is obtained via site usage tracking or when you voluntarily provide the information to us, such as, for example, by filling in forms on the Site.
          </p>
          <p>
            Company uses personal information to answer your questions; provide products, services or information you request; to communicate with you; to provide marketing materials from Company or others with whom we have a relationship with.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you choose to provide us with personal information, you can be assured it will be used only to support your relationship with Company or as otherwise described herein.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, personal information you voluntarily provide may be collected and stored to permit you to receive Company&#39;s e-newsletters and/or e-mail, participate in online support or &quot;Ask the Expert&quot; services and for marketing and administrative purposes.  It may also be used to fulfill your requests for orders, sample products or information from Company from time to time, to request product support, ask a question, report a problem with the Sites, participate in promotions, sweepstakes or contests. Additionally, you cannot communicate with Company through the &quot;Contact&quot; or customer support links on the Site or via e-mail without providing personal information.  If you contact Company or its service providers, a record of that session or correspondence will be maintained.
          </p>
          <p>
            Company may disclose personal information that we collect or you provide as described in this privacy policy: (i) to our parent company, subsidiaries and affiliates; (ii) to contractors, service providers and other third parties we use to support our business or (iii) with your consent, to companies who offer products that may be of interest to you. These companies may then contact you directly with product or sample offers, personalized offers and information or to ask for your feedback on products and programs that may be of interest to you.  Information collected may be also used to customize Licensed Content (as defined in the site Terms of Use), fulfill your product information requests, improve services, contact you (for example, to notify you of new or improved products or product uses), conduct research, advertising, direct mail and email campaigns, and to provide anonymous reporting for internal use and to third parties. Company reserves the right to conduct additional processing and transfer to the extent permitted or required by law, or in support of any legal or criminal investigation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Company takes appropriate measures in light of the nature of the personal information we collect and the risks associated with processing that personal information in order to keep it secure and to reduce the risk that your personal information may be accessed, altered, damaged or used without authorization.  Company may combine information collected about you with information obtained directly or through its affiliated companies, business partners or other companies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Should you wish to update your information, be removed from Company programs for which you previously registered or to prevent further use of your personal information or stop receiving communications from Company, please follow the directions set forth in Section 11 of our Terms of Use.
          </p>
          <p>
            If all or part of Company or any of its affiliates are sold, merged, or otherwise transferred to another entity, your personal and non-personal information may be transferred as part of that transaction or process.  Company may also disclose your personal information: (i) to comply with any court order, law or legal process, including to respond to any government or regulatory request; (ii) if Company believes disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of Company, our customers or others; or (iii) if Company has reason to believe that disclosure is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action to enforce any of Company&#39;s rights, including against you or a third party, for nonpayment, violation of any agreement with Company, and to prevent injury to or interference with Company&#39;s rights or property, or the rights or property of other Company users or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.  Company may disclose or access account information when Company believes in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that Company deems necessary to maintain, service and improve Company products and services and to protect its rights or property. By accessing and using the Site, you agree that information you have provided may be disclosed as described above or as may be modified from time to time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Except for any personal information Company may collect from you as described in this Privacy Policy, any material, information or other communication you transmit, upload or post to the Site or email to Company (&quot;Communications&quot;) will be considered non-confidential and nonproprietary.  Company will have no obligation to preserve the confidentiality or refrain from disclosing Communications.  Company will have no liability for and will be free to copy, disclose, distribute, incorporate and otherwise use the Communications and all data, images, sounds, text, product ideas, suggestions or enhancements, as well as anything embedded therein for any and all commercial or noncommercial purposes.
