            and its associated websites, webpages, content and other materials (collectively the &#34;Site&#34;) to provide to you information about COMPANY, its industry and products. Your access to and use of the Site is subject to these Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy found at A/D Fire Protection Systems and all applicable laws. By accessing the Site, you accept, without limitation or qualification, these Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy. You should review the most current version of the Terms of Use and the Privacy Policy often as they may be modified from time to time and the terms, as modified, will govern your use of the Site. All changes are effective immediately when we post them, and apply to all access to and use of the Site thereafter and your continued use of the Site after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes. Any new features that augment or enhance the Site also will be subject to these Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.
          </p>
          <p> <strong>1. Generally</strong>

            You are free to browse the Site, to access company periodic e-newsletters, technical libraries, view product catalog(s), submit questions, participate in any contests, promotions, surveys or other services and view any other information contained on the site. This and all other company-approved material available on the Site is referred to as &#34;Licensed Content.&#34; You may view and print portions of the Licensed Content for your own internal use but not for resale or other commercial exploitation and not for use other than as provided in these Terms of Use and the Privacy Policy.

            While COMPANY uses commercially reasonable efforts to provide accurate information, the industries of which COMPANY is a part and the jurisdictions in which the company operates and the laws and regulations applicable to those industries and jurisdictions change frequently. Therefore information contained on the Site may not be current or accurate. Because many factors go into the decision-making process of purchasing a given product and everyone&#39;s particular circumstances and needs may differ, the Licensed Content is provided for informational purposes only. COMPANY cannot ensure or guarantee and does not warrant that your product selection will be accurate, meet your particular needs or requirements or that the recommendations, regulations or other information provided is complete, accurate or current for your specific needs (see our disclaimer of warranties in Section 10 below). Each claim or statement about the effectiveness of COMPANY products and/or claims or statements comparing the effectiveness of COMPANY products to that of others is expressly limited to the country of applicability as referenced on the site and if no country is referred, the United States, unless otherwise stated on the Site. If a product or sample offered by COMPANY through the Site is not as described, your sole remedy is to return it in its original, unused form and receive either a replacement of the product you purchased or a refund of the price you actually paid. Product description and pricing is subject to correction and change. COMPANY may refuse or cancel product orders placed at an incorrect price, or based upon erroneous promotion terms, whether or not the order has been confirmed. Sales made through the Site, if any, are governed by COMPANY Standard Terms and Conditions of Sale and/or Invoice-Terms and Conditions.

            <strong>12. General Information</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            These Terms of Use and any other agreements, whether or not referenced herein, constitute the entire agreement between you and COMPANY with regard to and shall govern your activities and use of the Site, superseding any prior agreements between you and COMPANY. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions contained in invoices, purchase orders, shipping manifests, bills of lading or terms and contracts that may apply when you purchase products or services or use affiliate services, third party content or third party software. These Terms of Use, your use of the Site and any other agreement with and the relationship between you and COMPANY shall be governed by the laws of A/D Fire Protection Systems without regard to choice of law provisions, nor shall the 1980 United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods apply. You and COMPANY agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the pertinent state or federal courts located within A/D Fire Protection Systems. By using this Site, you agree that COMPANY, in its sole discretion, may require you to submit any disputes arising from use of this Site, these Terms of Use or the Privacy Policy concerning or including disputes arising from or concerning the interpretation, violation, nullity, invalidity, non-performance or termination, as well as disputes filling gaps in contract or its newly arisen circumstances, to final and binding arbitration under the International Rules of Arbitration of the American Arbitration Association by one arbitrator appointed in accordance with said Rules. Notwithstanding these rules, however, such proceeding shall be governed by the laws of the A/D Fire Protection Systems and shall take exclusively in A/D Fire Protection Systems as set forth in this Section. Any arbitration award initiated under this clause shall be limited to monetary damages and not equitable relief. Further, the arbitrator shall have no authority to award punitive, consequential or other damages not measured by the prevailing party&#39;s actual direct damages in any arbitration initiated pursuant to this Section except as required by statute. Notwithstanding the foregoing, COMPANY may seek equitable relief, including preliminary and permanent injunction, in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent or enjoin misappropriation, misuse, unauthorized disclosure or infringement of any intellectual property rights. The failure of COMPANY to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the Terms of Use or the Privacy Policy is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties&#39; intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms of Use remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, you must file any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to your use of the Site, Terms of Use or the Privacy Policy within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. The section titles in the Terms of Use are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
